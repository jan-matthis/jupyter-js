# Jupyter JS

Javascript bits for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), mostly additional hotkeys. See comments in `custom.js` for details.

## Installation

Copy the contents of `custom.js` to the file `custom/custom.js` in your profile folder. By default, on a unix-based system, the profile folder is located at: `~/.jupyter/`.
